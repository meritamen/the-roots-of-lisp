# the-roots-of-lisp

This is a Lisp interpreter based on Paul Graham's famous article The Roots of Lisp. I have implemented the interpreter with the seven atoms described inthe article, without adding any additional features. Of course, the initial version I implemented included integers and strings as data structures, but I removed them for the sake of purity. If you wanted to add extensions, it would be easy to do so. The implementation draws inspiration from Write You A Scheme in 48 Hours and Write You A Scheme, Version 2.
